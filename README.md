# React Learning Exercises at BeCode ⚛️

This repository contains exercises and projects focused on learning **React**. These exercises were completed as part of my training at **BeCode**, and they aim to strengthen my understanding of key React concepts such as **state management**, **event handling**, and **component-based architecture**.

## Overview 📋

In this repository, you will find:  

- Exercises on form validation, covering **state management** with `useState`, handling **events** with `onSubmit` and `onChange`, and providing real-time feedback.  
- A simple project to practice creating and structuring React components, using **props**, and experimenting with the basics of React.  
- A foundational approach to understanding React's declarative style and reusable component structure.  

## Why This Project? 🤔

React is a powerful library for building modern, interactive web applications. Through this project, I have:  

- Explored how to manage component state and respond to user input dynamically.  
- Learned to build reusable, modular components for scalability and maintainability.  
- Practiced key concepts such as **props**, **state**, **event handling**, and **conditional rendering** to create interactive interfaces.  

## Repository Structure 📂

The repository is organized as follows:  

- **`01.exo1`**:  
  An exercise to implement a fully functional form validation system with real-time feedback and submission display.  
- **`Premier-Site-REACT`**:  
  A simple project created to experiment with React fundamentals, such as component creation and state management.
